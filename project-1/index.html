    <h2>Poem:Fire and Ice</h2>

    <h3>By Robert Frost</h3>

    <hr />

    <pre><b>
    Some say the world will end in fire,
    Some say in ice.
    From what I've tasted of desire
    I hold with those who favor fire,
    But if it had to perish twice,
    I think I know enough of hate
    To say that for destruction Ice
    Is also great
    And would suffice.</b>
