    <h2>Poem:Fire and Ice</h2>

    <h3>By Robert Frost</h3>

    <hr />

    <p><b>
    Some say the world will end in fire,<br>
    Some say in ice.<br>
    From what I've tasted of desire<br>
    I hold with those who favor fire,<br>
    But if it had to perish twice,<br>
    I think I know enough of hate<br>
    To say that for destruction Ice<br>
    Is also great<br>
    And would suffice.</b>
