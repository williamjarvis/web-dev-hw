**Version Control System**

Describe what a version control system is, and why we are using one in this class. A version control system is for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files with multiple other people. This enables the user to view the complete history of the repository. We are using this in our class so that we may go back and see our mistakes and correct them and so other classmates and our instructor may also see our progress.

**Summary of Work Cycle**

*The work I did in this cycle was very tedious and time consuming trying to follow all the directions in the turorials. However, by the time I reached the assignment portion I was very confused. This is a lot to take in at one time and produce quality results.

*I had many issues and problems, too many to go into.

*There is nothing in particular that I would like to discuss further.

*No, I had no time to post any of my problems with the repo. I was not able to help any of my classmates out with this past homework cycle because I barely know what I am doing in this class so far because this is all new to me.
