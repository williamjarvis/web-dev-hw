# Part 2: Technical Report
***
1. A page can only have one main head element (opening and closing), which contains the metadata for the page, and only one main body element(opening and closing), which contains the code elements that are visable.This is to ensure the codes are properly processed, displayed and function correctly on a web page.
2. Semantic Markup is text elements that add extra information to the page but are not intended to affect the structure. Structural elements are intented to affect the structure.
3. This work cycle I felt rushed trying to digest all the new text elements in the tutorial part, then remember them correctly to complete the assignment. I used our textbook, and went back to the tutorial when I was not sure of myself. I am still very new to this but this week seemed a bit easier workflow because I am starting to feel somewhat more comfortable with this new language.
