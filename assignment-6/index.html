        <p>This is truly the age of wonders.  It is also the age and day of blunted vision and warped perspective.
           You and I are apt to lose all sense of proportion and relative value as we sit and watch to-day's panorama
           of epoch making history unfold itself.</P>
        <p>Great events, marvelous discoveries and miracle-like inventions have followed each other in such rapid succession
           during the past few years that the ear rings, the eye swims and the brain becomes confused when we attempt to grasp,
           analyze and mentally catalog in its proper place, each of these new, all important things-contributing causes to the
           revolutionary readjustment of that scheme of life which was ours but a few years back.

        <p>The year 1866 was signalized by a remarkable incident,<span class="emphasis">"a mysterous and inexplicable phenomenon,"</span> which doubtless no one has
           yet forgotten.  Not to mention rumors which agitated the maritime population, excited the public mind, even in the interior
            of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited.  Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of
            Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the governments of several states on the two continents,<span class="emphasis"> "were deeply
            interested in the matter."</span></p>
          <p>For some time past, vessels had been met by<span class="emphasis"> "an enormous thing,"</span> a long shaped object spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent,
             and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.</P>
          <p>The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring
             rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed.</p>
