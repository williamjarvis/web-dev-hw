         This DIY project is simple and can be done in a short amount of time using a basic
         amount of tools.  I chose this project because the holidays are coming up, and it is
         a classy gift Idea for a college student on a tight budget to make for a<br>
         friend or family member.</em></strong>

         <h2 align="center"><u><b>List of Materials:</b></u></h2>
         <ul>
           <li>1- Thick Rough sawn piece of weathered wood, at least 2 inches thick and 4 inches wide.
                  Length depends upon<br>
                  how many candles you wish to use. I recommend using an odd
                  number of votive candles, 3 minimum, 5 for a<br>
                  nice effect!</li>
           <li>2- Horseshoes.</li>
           <li>4- 8d common nails. You need this length to attach the horseshoes securely. I prefer to
                  to use 4- 2 inch grabber<br>
                  screws and use a drill to attach more securely, and to avoid damage to the horseshoes,
                  using a hammer may do<br>
                  that! Your choice!</li>
           <li>1- Sheet medium grit sandpaper.</li>
           <li>5- Votive candles. Measure bottom diameter of glass to determine what width Spade
                  Drill Bit you will be need<br>
                  to use.<em>I recommend measuring in-store before you buy, and buying candles with a
                  slightly-smaller-than 2 inch<br>
                  bottom.</em></li>
           <li>1- 2 inch wide Spade Bit type drill bit.</li>
           <li>1- Electric or battery powered drill.</li>
           <li>1- Hammer. Only needed if your going to use nails to secure the horseshoes to the wood.</li>
           <li>1- Hand or Power Saw. Only if you plan on cutting the piece down to a different length.
                  Hopefully you will be<br>
                  able to find a length that is suitable without cutting</li>
           <li>1- Straight edge Ruler.</li>
           <li>1- Measuring Tape</li>
           <li>1- Pencil</li>
           <li>1- Pair of Safety Goggles <b><em>Please wear when using saw and when drilling</em></b>.</li>

        <h2 align="center"><u><b>Step 1:</b></u></h2>
            <image src="images/two.JPG" alt="layout drill holes" width="800px" height="450px" />

         <ul>
           <li> Once you have gathered all your materials, place the 5 votive candles on top of the wood to
                get an idea of your<br> candle spacing layout.</li>
           <li> Use pencil to ligtly circle around candle base.</li>
           <li> Remove candles from wood and measure to make sure you are evenly spaced at the center of
                each penciled circle, both length and width wise from the edges of the wood. Mark center point
                of circle. This center point is where you place Spade Drill
                Bit to drill in Step 2. Once you
                have figured out your desired spacing, you can mark an end of the length to cut with the saw
                if you need to at this point.</li>
           <li> Cut wood to desired length. <b><em>Don't forget to put on your safety goggles when you use
                the saw to cut your length down!</em></b></li>
         </ul>

          <h2 align="center"><u><b>Step 2:</b></u></h2>
              <image src="images/four.JPG" alt="drilling holes" width="800px" height="450" />

          <ul>
            <li>Measure up one half inch from the bottom of the Spade Bit on both sides of the blade and
                use a straight edge to mark a horizontal line across the Spade Bit blade from one edge to the other.
                Then use a bright colored marker or some bright colored nail polish to make the line more visable.
                This will be the line that you will drill your holes depth to. <b><em>Don't forget to put on your Safety
                goggles when you drill!</em></b></li>
            <li>Lightly sand any rough edges around the holes drilled with your medium grit sandpaper.</li>
            <li>If you prefer to stain the board, this is the point to do so before attaching horseshoes.
                 <b><em>My recommendation would<br> be to leave the wood natural for two reasons. The first is that the
                wood is already weathered and naturally rustic. The second is that I do not like the idea of
                making wood even more flammable by adding a flammable enhancing substance like a stain.</em></b></li>
          </ul>

          <h2 align="center"><u><b>Step 3:</b></u></h2>
               <image src="images/five.png" alt="nailing horseshoes onto board" width="800px" height="450px" />

          <ul>
            <li>Position horseshoe on each end of wood and hammer 8d common nails or fasten with 2 inch long grabber screws.</li>
            <li>Place your votive candles into all the holes and the project is finished.</li>
            <li><em>Note: If you go to the original website, via the link in the about page, you will notice the image on the website also<br> has
                same slight blur as the image above. This is photograher out of focus error, and not this web page designers<br> error. I opted
                to use this image anyway because it does show placement of the horseshoe on the end of the wood,<br> and where to fasten it.</em></li>
