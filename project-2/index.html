         This DIY project is simple and can be done in a short amount of time using a basic
         amount of tools.  I chose this project because the holidays are coming up, and it is
         a classy gift Idea for a college student on a tight budget to make for a friend or
         family member.</em></strong>

         <h2 align="center"><u><b>List of Materials:</b></u></h2>
         <ul>
           <li>1- Thick Rough sawn piece of weathered wood, at least 2 inches thick and 4 inches wide.
                  Length depends upon how many candles you wish to use. I recommend
                  using an odd number of votive candles, 3 minimum, 5 for a nice effect!</li>
           <li>2- Horseshoes.</li>
           <li>4- 8d common nails. You need this length to attach the horseshoes securely. I prefer to
                  to use 4- 2 inch grabber screws and use a drill to attach more securely, And to
                  avoid damage to the horseshoes, using a hammer may do that! Your choice. </li>
           <li>1- Sheet medium grit sandpaper.</li>
           <li>5- Votive candles. Measure bottom diameter of glass to determine what width paddle
                  drill bit you will be need to use. I recommend measuring in-store before you buy,
                  and buying candles with a slightly-smaller-than 2 inch bottom.</li>
           <li>1- 2 inch wide paddle drill bit.</li>
           <li>1- Electric or battery powered drill.</li>
           <li>1- Hammer. Only needed if your going to use nails to secure the horseshoes to the wood.</li>
           <li>1- Hand or Power Saw. Only if you plan on cutting the piece down to a different length.
                  Hopefully you will be able to find a length that is suitable without cutting</li>
           <li>1- Straight edge Ruler.</li>
           <li>1- Measuring Tape</li>
           <li>1- Pencil</li>
           <li>1- Pair of Safety Goggles to wear when using saw and when drilling.</li>
         </ul>

            <p align="left">
              Once you have gathered all your materials. Place the 5 votive candles on top of the wood to
              get an idea of your candle spacing layout. Use pencil to ligtly circle around candle base.
              Remove candles from wood and measure to make sure you<br> are evenly spaced at the center of
              each penciled circle, both length and width wise from the edges of the wood. Mark center point
              of circle. This center point is where you place paddle drill bit to drill in Step 2. Once you
              have figured out your desired spacing you can mark an end of the length to cut with the saw if
              you need to at this point. Cut wood to desired length.
