    <ul>
      <li>My name is William. I am a Media Arts student at the University of Montana. I am currently
          taking, the Introduction to Web Design and Development course, that is
          required to complete<br> my degree program.</li><br />

      <li>I chose the DIY Rustic Horseshoe Votive Candleholder for my instructable
          project because it is a great holiday gift Idea to make for a friend or family
          member. It is a project that a student<br> who has little time, skill, or money
          can make in a short amount of time, and produce a very nice gift!</li><br />
